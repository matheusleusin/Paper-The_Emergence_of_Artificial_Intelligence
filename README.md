# Paper-The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Intelligence

This repository relates to the **working paper** entitled *"An evolutionary view on the emergence of Artificial Intelligence"*, available in http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00233. 
The current repository is based on two codes, described below:

- The code "*Fields_analysis*" is used for analysing patents using the technological fields' classification, which is also the one used for calculating the measures of complexity and relatedness presented in the paper; this code generates Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, presented in the paper; 
- The code "*4-digits_analysis*" is used for analysing patents using the 4-digits IPC classification, a.k.a. subclass codes; this code generates Figure 6, presented in the paper;

Moreover, there are three folders in this repository:
- a folder named "Files_created_with_the_code", which contains all data ("*Files_created_with_the_code/data*") and figures ("*Files_created_with_the_code/figures*") generated through the codes;
- a folder named "other_files", which contains additional information needed for running the codes. This information includes a file ("ipc_technology.csv") used to translate 4 digits IPC codes into IPC technological fields (used in the code "*Fields_analysis*"); a file with all AI patents identifying through our keyword-based search ("IPCs_AI"), and a file containing labels used for defining the labels used in Figure 6 of the paper ("Summary IPC labels"). 
- a hidden folder named "large_files", which contains the large files with all priority patents used in the analysis, and is defined through a ".gitignore" file to not be updated. These big files (i.e. *All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1, All_patents_and_IPCs_Part2, All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1,* and *All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part2*) are not made publicly available because they comprise a significant share of data owned by Patstat 2019. A small sample of them is available in the folder "*other files*". The file "All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader" contains a sample of the files used in the code "*Fields_analysis*", whereas the file "All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader" contains a sample of the files used in the code "*4-digits_analysis*". You can build these datasets by applying the strategy presented in De Rassenfosse et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0264-6) for identifying first filings and the geolocation of their respective inventors to Patstat 2019 spring version.
