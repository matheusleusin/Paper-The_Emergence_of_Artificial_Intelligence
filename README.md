# Paper-The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Intelligence

This repository relates to the **working paper** entitled *"An evolutionary view on the emergence of Artificial Intelligence"*, available in http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00233. 
The current repository is based on two codes, described below:

- The code "*Fields_analysis*" is used for analysing patents using the technological fields' classification, which is also the one used for calculating the measures of complexity and relatedness presented in the paper; this codes generates Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, presented in the paper; 
- The code "*4-digits_analysis*" is used for analysing patents using the 4-digits IPC classification, a.k.a. subclass codes; this code generates Figure 6, presented in the paper;

The big files (i.e. *All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1, All_patents_and_IPCs_Part2, All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1,* and *All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part2*) which are used in each of these codes are not made publicaly available because they comprise a significant share of data owned by Patstat 2019. A small sample of them is available in the folder "*other files*". The file "All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader" contains a sample of the files used in the code "*Fields_analysis*", whereas the file "All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader" contains a sample of the files used in the code "*4-digits_analysis*".

The data produced using these codes is saved in the folder "*Files_created_with_the_code/data*", while the figures are saved in "*Files_created_with_the_code/figures*".
