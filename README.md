# Paper: Breaking In, Breaking Through, or Just Breaking the Cycle? How Local Specialisations Steer Global AI Leadership

This repository relates to the **working paper** entitled *"Breaking In, Breaking Through, or Just Breaking the Cycle? How Local Specialisations Steer Global AI Leadership"*, which was submitted to Technological Forecasting and Social Change. 
The repository contains files that can be used to reproduce and to check all of the calculations and figures presented in the paper. It includes two R codes (one that reproduces the main figures, named *"1.Main_code.R"*, and one that reproduces the figures presented in the appendix, named *"2.Appendix_Figures.R"*). There is also a markdown implementation file (named *"1.Main_code_markdown.Rmd"*) that explains step-by-step all of the analyses included in the main R code. This markdown is also offered as a [pdf](https://github.com/matheusleusin/Paper-The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Intelligence/blob/master/1.Main_code_markdown.pdf) file to facilitade visualizing its step-by-step reproduction.

The folders named **"large_files"** and **"other_files"** are used as input to run all codes. The first folder, **"large_files"**, contains data about patent and inventors' location information for all priority patents available in PATSTAT 2019 (spring edition) for the period from 1974 to 2018. Due to Intellectual Property rights of PATSTAT (and size limitations), these files are not made available here (the whole repository is set to be ignored via .gitignore). These large files are divided into two different files (one used for technological fields analysis, and one for subclasses analysis), and each of these types of files is divided in two parts (due to size). One part (always named Part1) contains data for the period from 1974 to 2003 (both years included), and the other (always named Part2) contains data for the period from 2004 to 2018 (also both years included). A small sample of these files is available in the folder **"other_files"**. 

The file *"All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader"* contains a sample of the files used to build the technological fields-based analysis, whereas the file *"All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader"* contains a sample of the files used to build the subclass-based analysis. If you want to run the code completely, you must generate the complete files by applying the strategy presented in De Rassenfosse et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0264-6) for identifying first filings and the geolocation of their respective inventors to PATSTAT 2019 spring version. These files must be saved in the aforementioned **"large_files"** folder. An overview of these files inside their respective folder is shown below:

Conversely, all files from the other folder, **"other_files"**, are made completely available.

All files generated by the codes are saved within the folder **"Files_created_with_the_code"**. This folder contains a subfolder named **"data"** and a subfolder named **"figures"**, on which the generated files are saved accordingly. The data subfolder contains two other subfolders: one that saves files linked to technological fields data (named **"files_code_Fields_analysis"**), and one that saves files linked to subclass data (named **"files_code_4-digits_analysis"**).

In short, the data files saved in the **"files_code_Fields_analysis"** folder are:

* **AI_ALL_patents.csv**: Contains detailed information on all patents identified as AI-related across the dataset. It serves as the primary dataset for analyzing AI technological development.
* **Data1period_RTA_techn_field.csv**: Captures RTA (Revealed Technological Advantage) values for technological fields linked to countries during the first interval (1974–1988). It highlights country-level specializations in each technological field during this interval.
* **Data2period_RTA_techn_field.csv**: Captures RTA values for technological fields linked to countries during the second interval (1989–2003). 
* **Data3period_RTA_techn_field.csv**: Captures RTA values for technological fields linked to countries during the third interval (2004–2018).
* **IPC_RTAs.csv**: Captures RTA values specifically calculated for technological fields. 
* **Matrix_IPC.csv**: Presents a matrix of IPC codes showing their co-occurrence in the dataset. It is used to identify relationships between technological fields.
* **Metrics_First_period.csv**: It contains the calculated metrics of RTA for each of the four main considered leading countries (China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA) in technological fields, as well as for AI technologies, in the first interval (1974–1988).
* **Metrics_Second_period.csv**: Contains the same metrics as the one mentioned above, but for the second interval (1989–2003).
* **Metrics_Third_period.csv**: Contains the same metrics as the one mentioned above, but for the third interval (2004–2018).
* **RTA_4countries_detailed.csv**: Also contains detailed RTA values for the four leading AI countries (China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA) in technological fields, but across all intervals. It contains the RTA values of these countries for the 3 considered types of specialisations (i.e., general, AI-specific, and coinciding) 
* **reg_techAI_FirstPeriod.csv**: Contains a list of the number of registers per technological field for ALL considered countries regarding *AI PATENTS* registered in the first interval (1974–1988).
* **reg_techAI_SecondPeriod.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the second interval (1989–2003).
* **reg_techAI_ThirdPeriod.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the third interval (2004–2018). 
* **reg_tech_FirstPeriod.csv**: Contains a list of the number of registers per technological field for ALL considered countries regarding *ALL PATENTS* (i.e., not only AI) registered in the first interval (1974–1988).
* **reg_tech_SecondPeriod.csv**:Similar to the file above, but for the second interval (1989–2003).
* **reg_tech_ThirdPeriod.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the third interval (2004–2018). 
* **Specializations_All_periods_IPC.csv**: Combines the files Metrics_First_period, Metrics_Second_period, and Metrics_Third_period to produce interval-specific specialisation-metrics for the whole period (1974–1988) at the technological field level.
* **Table_appendix.xlsx**: Contains supplementary tables used for the paper's appendices. It includes data supporting additional analyses presented for the four countries and types of specialisations considered.

The data files saved in the **"files_code_4-digits_analysis"** folder are:

* **Data1period_RTA_subclass.csv**: Provides  calculated RTA values for specific IPC subclasses during the first interval (1974–1988). Thus, it is similar to the file Data1period_RTA_techn_field.csv, but for subclasses instead of technological fields. 
* **Data2period_RTA_subclass.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the second interval (1989–2003).
* **Data3period_RTA_subclass.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the third interval (2004–2018). 
* **RTA_1st_AI.csv**: Contains RTA values for subclasses specifically calculated based on *AI PATENTS* registered during the first interval (1974–1988).
* **RTA_2nd_AI.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the second interval (1989–2003).
* **RTA_3rd_AI.csv**: Similar to the file above, but for the third interval (2004–2018). 
* **IPC_RTAs_subclass.csv**: It combines the 6 files presented above to summarize in one table all general and AI-specific specialisations per interval for the whole period (1974–2018) for IPC subclasses.
