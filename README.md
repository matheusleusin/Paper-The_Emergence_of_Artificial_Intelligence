# Replication Code for "Breaking in or Breaking Through? How Local Specialisations Shape the Integration of AI Technologies"

This repository contains the full R implementation for the analysis presented in the paper: *"Breaking in or Breaking Through? How Local Specialisations Shape the Integration of AI Technologies"* (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10438599.2025.2558626).

The code and supporting files can be used to reproduce all calculations, figures, and robustness analyses presented in the paper.

## Quick Start & How to Run

1.  **Step-by-step Guide**: For a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of the main analysis, please see the R Markdown file `index.Rmd` or the compiled [html](https://matheusleusin.github.io/Paper-The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Intelligence/). This file explains the entire analytical pipeline, from data preparation to the generation of the main figures and econometric analyses. It also contains the additional regressions performed for Table 3 and Table 4, which are briefly mentioned in the footnotes of the paper.

5.  **Running the Scripts**: The analysis is divided into three main R scripts that should be run in order:
    *   `1.Main_code.R`: Generates the primary results and main figures of the paper.
    *   `2.Figures_appendix.R`: Reproduces the figures presented in the appendices.
    *   `3.Robustness_analysis.R`: Conducts the additional robustness checks, such as varying time intervals and RTA thresholds.

## Data Requirements

Running the code in this repository requires two sets of input data, organized into the `large_files` and `other_files` folders.

### ⚠️ Required Proprietary Data (`large_files`)

The `large_files` folder is designed to contain the complete patent and inventor location data from the **PATSTAT 2019 (spring edition)** database for the period 1974–2018.

**Important:** Due to PATSTAT's intellectual property restrictions and large file sizes, this raw data is **not provided** in this repository (the folder is ignored by `.gitignore`).

**For users without a PATSTAT license:** A similar, publicly available dataset that links patents to inventor locations can be accessed here: [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OTTBDX](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OTTBDX).

**For users with a PATSTAT license wishing to perform a full replication:** You will need to generate the input files following the geolocational strategy presented in De Rassenfosse et al. (2019) and structure them as follows:
*   The data should be split into two categories for the two levels of analysis: **technological fields** and **IPC subclasses**.
*   Due to their size, each category must be further divided into two parts:
    *   `Part1`: containing data from 1974 to 2003 (inclusive).
    *   `Part2`: containing data from 2004 to 2018 (inclusive).

### ✅ Provided Supporting Files (`other_files`)

The `other_files` folder **is included** in this repository and contains all other necessary input files. Crucially, this folder also includes small **data samples** (e.g., `All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader.csv`) to illustrate the exact format, column names, and structure required for the proprietary data.

## Repository Structure

*   **`large_files/` (User-provided):** Destination for large, proprietary PATSTAT data files. This folder is listed in `.gitignore`. An overview of these files inside their respective folder is shown below:
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70388ae2-e728-40f0-b586-4fbada2a2351)


*   **`other_files/` (Included):** Contains all necessary supporting data and samples of the proprietary files to show the required format.
*   **`Files_created_with_the_code/` (Generated):** This is the output directory where all generated data and figures are saved. It is organized into two subfolders:
    *   **`data/`**: Contains all processed datasets and analytical results. It is further subdivided into `files_code_Fields_analysis/` and `files_code_4-digits_analysis/`.
    *   **`figures/`**: Contains all figures generated by the R scripts.

**Note on `.gitignore`**: In addition to `large_files/`, a subfolder for the permutation data (`Files_created_with_the_code/data/files_code_4-digits_analysis/robustness/`) is also ignored due to its large size (>1GB). The code will generate these files if run.

## Description of Key Generated Data Files

The R scripts will generate a number of intermediate and final data files. The most important outputs saved in `Files_created_with_the_code/data/` include:

### Technological Fields Analysis (`files_code_Fields_analysis/`)

*   **`reg_tech_*.csv` & `reg_techAI_*.csv`**: These files contain the foundational patent counts per country, per technological field, for each of the three main time intervals, for both 'general' (all patents) and 'AI-specific' patents.
*   **`Data*period_RTA_techn_field.csv`**: Contains the calculated RTA values for all countries and technological fields for each of the three main intervals.
*   **`RTA_4countries_detailed.csv`**: A summary file containing the detailed RTA values and specialization types ('general', 'AI-specific', 'coinciding') for the four leading countries across all periods.

### IPC Subclass Analysis (`files_code_4-digits_analysis/`)

*   **`Data*period_RTA_subclass.csv`**: The equivalent of the RTA files above, but at the more granular IPC subclass level.
*   **`RTA_*_AI.csv`**: Contains the RTA values for subclasses calculated using only AI patents for each of the three intervals.
*   **`IPC_RTAs_subclass.csv`**: A summary file combining the general and AI-specific subclass specializations for all intervals.

Many other files are generated, particularly for the robustness analyses, which typically recalculate these core datasets under different time intervals or RTA thresholds.
