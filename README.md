# Paper_AI_as_a_GPT

This repository relates to a **working paper** analysing the emergence of AI as a GPT. It is based on two codes, described below:

- The code "*Fields analysis*" is used for analysing patents using the technological fields' classification, which is also the one used for calculating the measures of complexity and relatedness presented in the paper; all the data produced using this code is saved in the folder "*Data_Final_code*", as well as Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8, also generated through it; 
- The code "*4-digits analysis*" is used for analysing patents using the 4-digits IPC classification, a.k.a. subclass codes; all the data produced using this code is saved in the folder "*Data_4digits_analysis*", as well as Figures 5 and 6, also generated through it;

The big files (i.e. *All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1, All_patents_and_IPCs_Part2, All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1,* and *All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part2*) which are used in each of these codes are not made publicaly available so far.
