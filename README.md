# Paper: Breaking In, Breaking Through, or Just Breaking the Cycle? How Local Specialisations Steer Global AI Leadership

This repository relates to the **working paper** entitled *"Breaking In, Breaking Through, or Just Breaking the Cycle? How Local Specialisations Steer Global AI Leadership"*, which was submitted to Technological Forecasting and Social Change. 
The repository contains files that can be used to reproduce and to check all of the calculations and figures presented in the paper. It includes two R codes (one that reproduces the main figures, named *"1.Main_code.R"*, and one that reproduces the figures presented in the appendix, named *"2.Appendix_Figures.R"*). There is also a markdown implementation file (named *"1.Main_code_markdown.Rmd"*) that explain step-by-step all of the analyses included in the main R code. This markdown also generates an [html file](https://matheusleusin.github.io/Paper-The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Intelligence/1.Main_code_markdown.html) that allows visualizing its step-by-step reproduction.

The folders named **"large_files"** and **"other_files"** are used as input to run all codes. The first folder, **"large_files"**, contains data about patent and inventors' location information for all priority patents available in PATSTAT 2019 (spring edition) for the period from 1974 to 2018. Due to Intellectual Property rights of patstat (and size), these files are not made available here (the whole repository is set to be ignored via .gitignore). They are divided into two different files (one used for technological fields analysis, and one for subclasses analysis), and each of these in two parts (due to size). One part (always named Part1) contains data for the period from 1974 to 2003 (both years included), and one contains data for the period from 2004 to 2018 (also both years included). A small sample of these files is available in the folder "**other files**". The file "All_patents_and_IPCs_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader" contains a sample of the files used to build the technological fields-based analysis, whereas the file "All_patents_and_IPC_codes_Part1_SmallSampleWithHeader" contains a sample of the files used to build the subclass-based analysis. If you want to run the code completely, you must generate the complete files by applying the strategy presented in De Rassenfosse et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0264-6) for identifying first filings and the geolocation of their respective inventors to Patstat 2019 spring version. These files must be saved in the aforementioned **"large_files"** folder. An overlook of these files in the respective folder is shown below:

Conversely, all files from the other folder, **"other_files"**, are made completely available.
All files generated by the codes are saved within the folder **"Files_created_with_the_code"**. This folder contains a subfolder named **"data"** and a subfolder named **"figures"**, on which the generated files are saved accordingly.
The data subfolder contains two other subfolders: one that saves files linked to technological fields data (named **"files_code_Fields_analysis"**), and one that saves files linked to subclass data (named **"files_code_4-digits_analysis"**).
In short, the data files saved in the **"files_code_Fields_analysis"** folder are:

 * AI_ALL_patents.csv: Contains detailed information on all patents identified as AI-related across the dataset. It serves as the primary dataset for analyzing AI technological development.
 * Data1period_RTA_techn_field.csv:  Captures RTA (Revealed Technological Advantage) values for technological fields linked to countries during the first period (1974–1988). It highlights country-level specializations in each technological field during this interval.
 * Data2period_RTA_techn_field.csv: Documents RTA values for technological fields linked to countries during the second period (1989–2003). It reflects changes in specialization dynamics compared to the first period.
 * Data3period_RTA_techn_field.csv: Records RTA values for technological fields linked to countries during the third period (2004–2018). It is used to analyze specialization trends in the most recent timeframe.
 * IPC_RTAs.csv: Contains RTA values specifically calculated for IPC (International Patent Classification) classes. This file enables a deeper understanding of country-level specializations at the IPC class level.
 * Matrix_IPC.csv: Presents a matrix of IPC codes showing their co-occurrence or linkages in the dataset. It is used to identify technological clusters or relationships between IPC codes.
 * Metrics_First_period.csv: Includes various calculated metrics (e.g., diversification, specialization) for the first period (1974–1988). It provides quantitative insights into innovation patterns during this timeframe.
 * Metrics_Second_period.csv: Contains calculated metrics for the second period (1989–2003). It allows comparison with the metrics from the first period to analyze temporal changes.
 * Metrics_Third_period.csv: Stores calculated metrics for the third period (2004–2018). It helps track innovation trends and specializations in the most recent phase.
 * RTA_4countries_detailed.csv: Provides detailed RTA values for four leading AI countries (China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA) across all periods. It focuses on country-level specializations and their evolution over time.
